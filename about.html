            Options

        <p>
            There are no options or additional settings for now, if you'd like to see any please <a href="https://github.com/ocvx/NoNext/issues/new">
                open an issue</a> on
            GitHub and I'll try to include it in the next version.

        <h3>
            Performance
        </h3>
        <p>In short, the extension isn't supposed to affect performance at all. If you're really obssessed with
            performance and/or a geek keep reading.</p>
        <p class="small">
            At length - the operations that the extension does aren't performance costly in the first place, but since
            this
            extension doesn't do anything significant - I made
            some efforts to minimize it even more.<br>
            This is how the extension works: the extension runs only in FB pages. Once in 4 seconds the extension
            checks if
            the page URL was changed to a video url, if it did - it attempts to find a video in the page and add an
            event
            listener to when the video ended. When the video ended the callback fires and searches for the 'cancel'
            button
            (a span
            element actually).<br>
            Running a function with a few dozens of operations once in a few seconds is neglectable, considering that
            nowdays CPUs do billions of operations per second. Adding an event listener and the callback itself -
            query-selecting to find the element and clicking it - aren't supposed to cost much too, not more than the
            user
            himself clicking it anyway.<br>
            I could've run a background page with a 'chrome.tabs.onUpdated' event listener in order to save polling the
            page every 4 seconds, but that would mean there would be a background page that would run a callback for
            each change in any page (not just FB's). I don't think that would really be more economical.
            <br><br>
            Anyways, I did also some tests to confirm that, if you came to a different conclusion let me know.
